    <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Ivan Arias, and I am a student of a Software Engineer. I am learning to build front-ends with ReactJS. Also, I am gaining a thorough understanding of Flask to create JSON APIs and then combine them with a scalable React front end, resulting in slick, functional, and interactive full-stack applications. I have a background in geological modeling and mapping software (GIS). I want to apply all my experience and the tech skill set I am building at Flatiron School to help develop modern web applications. |</p>
